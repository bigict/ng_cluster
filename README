IEDB Next-Generation Tools Cluster Analysis - version 0.1 beta
==============================================================

Introduction
------------
This tool groups epitopes into clusters based on sequence identity. 
A cluster is defined as a group of sequences which have a sequence similarity 
greater than the minimum sequence identity threshold specified.  This
standalone tool handles most of the data processing for the Cluster
tool at https://nextgen-tools.iedb.org/pipeline?tool=cluster.

The algorithm behind this tool is the same that drives the cluster 2.0
tools at https://tools.iedb.org/cluster.


Release Notes
-------------
v0.1 beta - Initial public beta release


Prerequisites
-------------
The following prerequisites must be met before installing the tools:

+ Linux 64-bit environment
  * http://www.ubuntu.com/
    - This distribution has been tested on Linux/Ubuntu 64 bit system.

+ Python 3.8 or higher
  * http://www.python.org/
   - Depending upon the Python version you are using, one of several included
     pip requirements files can be used.  See below for details.

+ ft2build.h
  * This library is necessary for building matplotlib
  To install this under ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev


Installation
------------
Below, we will use the example of installing to /opt/iedb_tools.

1. Extract the code and change directory: 
  $ mkdir /opt/iedb_tools
  $ tar -xvzf IEDB_CLUSTER-VERSION.tar.gz -C /opt/iedb_tools
  $ cd /opt/iedb_tools/cluster-VERSION

2. Optionally, create and activate a Python 3.8+ virtual environment using your favorite virtual environment manager.  Here, we will assume the virtualenv is at ~/virtualenvs/cluster:
  $ python3 -m venv ~/venvs/cluster
  $ source ~/venvs/cluster/bin/activate

3. Install python requirements.  Depending upon the version of python under which
this will be installed, use one of the files in the 'requirements' directory.

  For Python 3.10 or higher:

    $ pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt

  For Python 3.9:

    $ pip install -r requirements/requirements-3.9.txt

  For Python 3.8:

    $ pip install -r requirements/requirements-3.8.txt



Usage
-----
python3 run_cluster.py -j <input_json_file> [-o] <output_prefix> [-f] <output_format>

The format of the input JSON file is described below.

The output_prefix and output_format are optional.  By default, the output will
be printed to the screen in TSV format.  Options are 'tsv' or 'json'.


Input formats
-------------
Currently, only JSON input is supported.

*NOTE*: This tool only accepts JSON inputs, formatted as described below

{
    "input_sequence_text": ">Mus Pep1\nLEQIHVLENSLVL\n>Mus Pep2\nFVEHIHVLENSLAFK\n>Mus Pep3\nGLYGREPDLSSDIKERFA\n>Mus Pep4\nEWFSILLASDKREKI",
    "method": "cluster-break",
    "cluster_pct_identity": 0.7,
    "peptide_length_range": [
        0,
        0
    ]
}

* input_sequence_text: a fasta-formatted string.  To create an appropriate string
    from a fasta file:
      awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' <fasta_file>
* method: the cluster method to use.  Descriptions of each method can be found
    at https://nextgen-tools.iedb.org/docs/tools/cluster.  Possible values are:
      - cluster-break
      - cluster
      - cliques
* cluster_pct_identity: The percent identity, expressed between 0 and 1, for members
    of a cluster.
* peptide_length_range: Minimum and maximum cutoffs for the lengths of peptides
    to include in the clustering.  The default of [0,0] indicates that all peptide
    lengths should be considered.


Caveats
-------
All IEDB next-generation standalones have been developed with the primary
focus of supporting the website.  Some user-facing features may be lacking,
but will be improved as these tools mature.
